### <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none">Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a>

I am pursuing my undergraduation here with a major in Instrumentation (Department of Electrical Engineering) and a minor in Computer Science.<br>
I am a border of <a href="http://rkhall.org/" style="text-decoration: none">Radhakrishnan Hall</a> and have been in the Basketball and Hardware Modelling teams.<br>
This is the oldest and the largest IIT and there are still places on campus that I probably haven't visited yet. Not being in a metropolitan city, we have created our own unique culture with lots of clubs, societies, events and activities. I am particularly proud of <a href="https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Students-IIT-KGP-Celebrate-Diwali-The-Festival-Of-Lights/#.g7a028x7s" style="text-decoration: none">Illumination</a> which takes place during Diwali.<br>
Sundar Pichai is our Alumni. Arvind Kejriwal is also our alumni :P

I went to school here for 14 years. It turned 178 when I graduated. I was taught Math by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ST_vrqMg_Q" style="text-decoration: none">David Royan</a>.<br>
I was alotted the <font color="red">Hastings house,</font> which probably led to my favourite colour becoming red. I used to represent my house in Athletics, March-Past and Basketball.<br>
My school was only 100 footsteps from home but I still managed to be late quite often somehow :P
