I went to school here for 14 years. It turned 178 when I graduated. I was taught Math by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ST_vrqMg_Q" style="text-decoration: none">David Royan</a>.<br>
My school was only 100 footsteps from home but I still managed to be late quite often somehow :P<br>
I was alotted the <font color="red">Hastings house,</font> which probably led to my favourite colour becoming red. I used to represented my house in Athletics and Basketball.
