## The Rat Race
My college requires us to compulsarily intern during our pre-final year summers. For this, the Career Development Centre(CDC) of the institute conducts an Internship season similar to Placements, at the start of the pre-final year.<br>
I had just completed a research based internship and was looking forward to intern in a corporate environment this time. Based on my skill set, I knew I was a suitable candidate for Banking and Software Companies.<br>
The internship process goes roughly in the following manner:

* Companies visit campus week after week. The first day is called Day-1 and so on. Every company usually wants the earliest slot possible and hence the first couple of days are the most competitive with high-paying, sought-after companies and profiles
* Most companies organise their own tests and group discussions before hand to shortlist candidates for the personal interview rounds that occur on the Day-x
* Students that register in CDC for internships, submit their Resumes and apply for the companies/profiles that they are interested in. The tests and GDs take place soon after and the rat race oficially begins

I spoke to seniors to clear all my doubts regarding Resume building, the companies I had shortlisted, interview and written test preparations. Goldman Sachs was number one on my list. It was a Day-1 company and they were offering roles in Software, Machine Learning and Quant.<br>
I took the tests and GDs and was shortlisted for four Day-I companies, including GS.

## Seven Deadly Rounds
Day-1 arrived. My first preference was GS, hence I was called by them first.<br>
My first interview started at about 8 am and in rapid succession I had seven rounds of interviews with seven different people. Each person with his/her own style and set of questions which they kept firing without stop till they were convinced with their evaluation. Each round lasted about thirty to forty minutes with a few minutes to breathe between them.<br>
I was allowed to leave at about 12:30 pm and I went straight for my second preference company where I gave another three rounds of interviews. At 3 pm, I was about to go for my fourth round when I was informed by a Placecom (students working with the CDC to ensure smooth functioning of the internship and placement seasons) that GS had announced their results and I had been selected.<br>
At that moment honestly, I was more relieved at the fact that I don't need to give any more interviews and I was done with the internship rat race once and for all. The happiness of getting my target company sunk in soon after.
