## The Rat Race
My college requires us to compulsarily intern during our pre-final year summers. For this, the Career Development Centre(CDC) of the institute conducts an Internship season similar to Placements, at the start of the pre-final year.<br>
I had just completed a research based internship and was looking forward to intern in a corporate environment this time. Based on my skill set, I knew I was a suitable candidate for Banking and Software Companies.<br>
The internship process goes roughly in the following manner:

* Companies visit campus week after week. The first day is called Day-1 and so on. Every company usually wants the earliest slot possible and hence the first couple of days are the most competitive with high-paying, sought-after companies and profiles
* Most companies organise their own tests and group discussions before hand to shortlist candidates for the personal interview rounds that occur on the Day-x
* Students that register in CDC for internships, submit their Resumes and apply for the companies/profiles that they are interested in. The tests and GDs take place soon after and the rat race oficially begins

I spoke to seniors to clear all my doubts regarding Resume building, the companies I had shortlisted, interview and written test preparations. Goldman Sachs was number one on my list. It was a Day-1 company and they were offering roles in Software, Machine Learning and Quant.<br>
I took the tests and GDs and was shortlisted for four Day-1 companies, including GS.

## Seven Deadly Rounds
Day-1 arrived. My first preference was GS, hence I was called by them first.<br>
My first interview started at about 8 am and in rapid succession I had seven rounds of interviews with seven different people. Each interviewer with his/her own style and set of questions which they kept firing till they were convinced with their evaluation. They were immaculately dressed and had the most polite behaviour even while putting me under pressure to see if I crack. The interviews are not simply one sided. While they were evaluating me, I was also creating an early impression of the company by observing them.<br>
Each round lasted about thirty to forty minutes with a few minutes to breathe between them. I was allowed to leave at about 12:30 pm and I went straight for the second company on my preference list. I gave three rounds of interviews there. At about 3 pm, I was about to go for my fourth round when I was informed by a Placecom (students working with the CDC to ensure smooth functioning of the internship and placement seasons) that GS had announced their results and I had been selected.<br>
At that moment, honestly, I was more relieved at the fact that I don't need to give any more interviews and I was done with the internship rat race once and for all. The happiness of getting my target company sunk in soon after.

## Summers in Bangalore
It was time for a new experience in a new city, and the very first one was about to be an amazing one: We got a one-week-all-expenses-paid-stay at Hilton! The idea was to provide all interns with a one week time to find a suitable place to stay for the rest of the internship. The hotel was about 50 footsteps from office.</p>
If I were to summarise my first week, the rough picture would be:

* Breakfast and swimming / gym / badminton at Hilton
* Training and Interaction / Networking Sessions at GS
* Lunch at Hilton
* More Training and Interaction / Networking Sessions at GS
* Dinner at Hilton

Fourteen people from my college had been selected by GS for internships and after the first week at Hilton, eleven of us were staying together at a place nearby. From the second week we started getting a clear idea about our projects and there was a lot of work to be done. GS is known to push all employees beyond their limits and compensates well.<br>
Weekends were the time to explore the city or travel to nearby places. Over the course of the internship, we were able to visit Pondicherry, Coorg and Mysore.<br>
The best thing about Bangalore was the weather. I didn't sweat even once during my internship and it was Summer! The worst thing about the city was the traffic. It was a nightmare and I honestly believe that you can reach places faster by walking than by car.<br>
The final two weeks comprised mostly of documenting all the work, interacting with the senior management, networking sessions and preparing my final presentation where I displayed my entire work and how it would make their lives easier and the system more powerful.<br>
I had to sign a non-disclosure agreement for the work I did. In basic terms, my work had solved some important issues that the team was facing. I made some fundamental changes to how certain things were being done to make them more intelligent and efficient. I also automated a lot of the grunt work that the employees were doing manually.<br>

I received a Pre-placement offer in October, the same year, to join as a full time employee after graduation, which I have accepted!
