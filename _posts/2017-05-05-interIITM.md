A week after the mid-semester examinations concluded, I had one big task at hand. The  student-run society and robotics hobby-maker group at IIT Kharagpur, [Technology Robotix Society](http://robotix.in), conducts technical workshops across the country to spread the culture of robotics; and this time, I, along with one of my co-subheads [Shivang Agrawal](http://www.shivangagrawal.in/) was supposed to spearhead it. The workshop was organized at [Bennett University](http://www.bennett.edu.in/), Noida. Needless to say, the two-day workshop was quite an experience and it's difficult to put down everything in a blog post.
